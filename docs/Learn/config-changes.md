# Config Change API Integration

Config change API allows users to send changes in their config (from internal tools and infrastructure), and see them as part of the Komodor Service view.

### How to use

##### Request URL
Mandatory query params will be used for service selection:
- serviceName 
- namespace
- clusterName

URL example
 https://api.komodor.com/v0/config_change?serviceName=backend-service&namespace=default&clusterName=production"

##### Authentication
To authenticate the request use API Key on your "REST API" integration tile in the Komodor app and add it to a header with `X-API-KEY` name.

The REST API key can be found in the [Integration page](https://app.komodor.com/main/integration).

If REST API integration isn't available for your account, please contact your account manager in Komodor.


##### Body

This is the event itself with the relevant configuration you want to be connected to the service as JSON.
	`{ key1: value1, key2: value2â€¦ }`

### Full Example


`curl -H "X-API-KEY: <rest api key>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"key":"value"}' "https://api.komodor.com/v0/config_change?serviceName=backend-service&namespace=default&clusterName=production"
`
