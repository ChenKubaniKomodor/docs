This includes all the \u201cextra\u201d fields used to tag and label your services, both for other team members and for external tools. BTW, We collect data from both annotations and labels. Where does Komodor utilize annotations? \u00b6 Everywhere! Komodor will use these annotations to create powerful connections between services and enrich service information in the following areas: Services explorer Related services Events screen Matching alerts to the correct services Official Kubernetes recommendations \u00b6 app.kubernetes.io/component : database app.kubernetes.io/part-of : wordpress app.kubernetes.io/managed-by : helm Komodor recommendations \u00b6 app.komodor.com/label.team : backend app.komodor.com/label.group : infrastructure app.komodor.com/label.owners : \"infa-team\" app.komodor.com/label.alert-team : \"devs\" app.komodor.com/label.Impacted-by : redis Usage example \u00b6 Tagging Team annotations on relevant services and adding relevant metadata on the alert metadata in datadog.

How it works? \u00b6 Each time a workload is rolled out, and a change has been made to the workload YAML, Komodor runs a set of statical checks in order to improve your YAML\u2019s reliability and efficiency. The results of our scan are presented under the \"Best Practices\u201d section within every service. If you wish to ignore any check, just click on the ignore button under the Best practices pop-up. Checks we run \u00b6 - Deployment Missing Replicas \u00b6 What is checked ? Check if there is only one replica for a deployment . Why should this be checked ? More than one replica recommended to be scheduled . - Tag Not Specified \u00b6 What is checked ? Check if an image tag is either not specified or the latest tag has not been used . Why should this be checked ? Docker 's latest tag is applied by default to images where a tag hasn' t been specified . Not specifying a specific version of an image can lead to a wide variety of problems . - Pull Policy Not Always \u00b6 What is checked ? Check if an image pull policy is not always . Why should this be checked ? By default , an image will be pulled if it isn 't already cached on the node attempting to run it . This can result in variations in images that are running per node , or potentially provide a way to gain access to an image without having direct access to the ImagePullSecret . - Liveness Probe Missing \u00b6 What is checked ? Check if a liveness probe is not configured for a pod . Why should this be checked ? Liveness probes are designed to ensure that an application stays in a healthy state . When a liveness probe fails , the pod will be restarted . - Readiness Probe Missing \u00b6 What is checked ? Check if a readiness probe is not configured for a pod . Why should this be checked ?
